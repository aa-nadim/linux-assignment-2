```

```bash
Make two scripts named access_log_process.sh and book_process.sh in a way so that when these files are executed, they display the tasks mentioned above in the terminal as output. 
Both files, access.log and book.txt, will be present in the present directory, from which the files will be executed.
Push the files into a git repository, and submit the repository link in the classroom.
```
